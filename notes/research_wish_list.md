## Autsim 
I've always thought that if I had access to data from UK Biobank, 23andMe, or AncestryDNA, I would perform this study:

I would use a polygenic risk score model to calculate the ASD risk based on genomics data and compare risk factors between different age groups. If a trend pointed towards an increase in younger cohorts, then there would be evidence that the observed trend in increasing rates of ASD reflects a true increase in rates rather than an increase in diagnoses.

For fun I also asked chatGPT4 to do an experiment design. Here is the conversation:

Human: 
> statement: "there is enough research evidence that autism has genetic basis" 
statement: "there is evidence that the rate of Autism spectrum disorder has been increasing over time"
validate both statements and if true, come up with a study design to use genetics information to decide whether the rise of autism reflctes a true trend or it is due to more cases being diagnoses rather than the rates actually increasing 

AI:

> Statement 1: "There is enough research evidence that autism has a genetic basis."
> Validation: This statement is correct. According to numerous studies, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a strong genetic basis. Research indicates that genes are one of the main causes of ASD, although environmental factors may also contribute. For example, twin and family studies have consistently demonstrated a high heritability of ASD. Various genetic disorders and gene mutations are associated with increased risk of ASD. Although the specific genes involved in ASD are not entirely known, it is clear that multiple genes are likely involved, perhaps in interaction with environmental factors. 

> Statement 2: "There is evidence that the rate of Autism spectrum disorder has been increasing over time."
Validation: This statement is also correct. Data from multiple countries, including the United States and UK, show a rise in the prevalence of ASD diagnoses over time. However, it's critical to understand that this doesn't necessarily mean the actual incidence of ASD is increasing. It's possible that this increase is due in part to better recognition and diagnosis of ASD, changes in diagnostic criteria, and increased awareness among healthcare providers and the public.

> #### Study Design: 
> ##### Title: "Investigating the Role of Genetic Factors in the Increasing Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders"
> ##### Objective: To determine whether the increase in the prevalence of ASD diagnoses reflects an actual rise in ASD or is due to an increase in diagnoses.

> ##### Design:

> 1. **Population-based cohort study**: Identify a large cohort of individuals diagnosed with ASD over several decades. Use existing healthcare and special education databases to identify these individuals. Also identify a control group of individuals without an ASD diagnosis.
> 2. **Genetic Analysis**: For the ASD cohort and the control group, obtain genetic data. This might involve collaborating with biobanks or conducting new genetic tests. Use modern genetic analysis techniques to identify potential ASD risk genes.
> 3. **Time Trend Analysis**: Analyze changes in the prevalence of ASD risk genes over time in both the ASD cohort and the control group.
> 4. **Correlational Analysis**: Determine whether changes in the prevalence of ASD diagnoses are correlated with changes in the prevalence of ASD risk genes.
> This design can help differentiate between an actual increase in ASD and an increase in diagnoses. If the prevalence of ASD risk genes has not changed significantly over time, this would suggest that the increase in ASD diagnoses is likely due to better recognition and diagnosis rather than an actual increase in ASD. Conversely, if the prevalence of ASD risk genes has increased significantly over time, this would suggest that the actual incidence of ASD might be increasing. 
> Note: This study would require significant resources, including access to large amounts of health and genetic data, as well as funding for genetic testing if necessary. Ethical considerations, including privacy and informed consent for genetic testing, would also need to be carefully addressed.


And when asked whether such a study has been conducted:

>As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, no such study combining all these elements has been conducted. There have been numerous genetic studies of autism, and there have been many studies investigating trends in autism prevalence over time, but these have generally been separate areas of research. 
The idea of directly comparing the prevalence of autism risk genes over time in autistic and non-autistic cohorts, as proposed in the above study design, is relatively novel and complex. As mentioned, such a study would involve substantial logistical, ethical, and financial challenges. However, as genetic research and data collection continue to advance, this kind of research could become more feasible in the future.
Please check the most recent literature or consult with a professional in the field for updates beyond my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.

Perhaps assuming we already have a model for polygenic risk in this case, we only need genetic data and age.
